# Line_follower_Robot
A small project where I model a line-following robot, simulate it in MuJoCo, and program it to autonomously follow a line.
All the uploaded files were in my urf folder on my desktop. To run the code: I navigate to the urf folder that contains all these documents, open the terminal, and write: python simulate.py -mjcf='scene.xml'

Model of the Robot:
